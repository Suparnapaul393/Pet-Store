			<h2 class="AboutUs"> About Us</h2>
		<p>A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal. Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances or relatable personalities.</p>
		<p>Pets provide their owners (or "guardians") both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive or emotional goals with patients.</p>
		<p>Teeny Paws offers the ultimate pet shop experience. It really is a paradise for pets and pet owners. We have all the pet supplies, pet food, and even you can take a tour with your family and friends.</p>
		<p>All our store colleagues are fully trained in pet care and dedicated to the welfare of your animals, with most of them being experienced pet owners themselves. So whether you are a new owner or an expert, our store colleagues are on hand to help you make the right choices.</p>
		<p>We believe in and promote responsible pet ownership. Not only are pets great companions and family members but there is evidence that they can help reduce stress in adults and help children to learn about life and even do better at school!</p>
		<p>If you are thinking of buying a pet, our trained store colleagues will spend time with you to make sure that you choose the right pet to suit yours and the animal's lifestyles. By matching owners and pets we hope to ensure a long and happy relationship. </p>
